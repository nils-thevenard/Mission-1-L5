// API 2 converting claim history into a rating

//we should seperate the function and supply it through server
//we setup the server like this
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const server = express();
server.use(bodyParser.json());
// server.listen(8001, () => {
//   console.log("Server started and listening on port 8001");
// });

//now we can create a path route for the API to pass the data to the correct function
//this would also be a good place to check the user input contains data and is not empty and define the error response
//defining the errors in the server means we don't have to call the function at all, reducing load and data handling
server.post("/calculateRisk", (req, res) => {
  const { claim_history } = req.body; //because our API is taking a JSON, we should seperate the data to a variable which we pass to the function, we also need to match the variable name to the JSON entry
  if (typeof claim_history !== "string" || claim_history.length < 1) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: "there is an error string" }); //when we return an error on the server, we should include a status code to define what the error type is to the end point
  }
  try {
    const riskRating = calculateRisk(claim_history);
    res.json({ risk_rating: riskRating }); //we should return the same format of data as we received, JSON
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: "there is an error response" });
  }
});

function calculateRisk(input) {
  //if we put the defined variables at the top we can identify what's being used inside the function easier
  const keyWords = ["smash", "crash", "bump", "scratch", "collide"];
  const words = input.split(" ");
  let count = 0;
  //because we added error handling to the server, we can remove the code for checking if the string is valid from here
  //For loop to check word list against the triggers
  for (const word of words) {
    if (
      keyWords.some((key) => word.toLowerCase().includes(key.toLowerCase()))
    ) {
      count++;
    }
    // Break out of the loop when count reaches 5
    if (count === 5) {
      break;
    }
